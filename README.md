# Filterit
Personal (public) portfolio work - code demonstration of a fully working app built in a reactive style.

A reactive (RxSwift) app which allows the user to apply various filters to images pulled from the web and save their work to a local library, synced for the user in iCloud. 

Created for iOS13. Note I'm using Storyboards rather than SwiftUI in this app.

### Demonstrated tech: 
- RxSwift 
- JSON 
- RESTful API prototype 
- CoreData 
- CloudKit
- et al.
